# Jammming ðŸŽµ

Jammming is a React web application that allows users to search for songs on Spotify, create custom playlists, and save them directly to their Spotify account. Users can search for tracks by song, album, or artist, add or remove tracks from their playlist, rename the playlist, and export it to Spotify with a single click. The app demonstrates React component architecture, state management, and integration with the Spotify Web API using the Implicit Grant Flow. Jammming provides a clean and interactive interface, allowing users to easily build and manage their playlists while learning modern React development practices.
